# TODO-List for this project

This is just my personal list of TODO-Notes on this project. Maybe there is something for you to do as well :)

## Hardware

- add rubber feet to the board shopping list
- Embed the USB Blaster directly on the board and remove the power connector. The board should only be powered via USB. See the following link for more information: [Blog-Post](https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/2024/06/fixing-a-knockoff-altera-usb-blaster-that-never-worked/)

## USB Blaster

- Provide a firmware for the possible onboard USB Blaster

## Enthusiast features
- create a patch for Quartus in order to support European logic symbols
- write own GUI application to draw circuits and call Quartus in the background for synthesis and upload (alternatively finalise the overlay). This UI needs to be better than the Quartus Software.
- Finally make the "Overlay" work!
