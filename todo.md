# TODO-List for this project

This is just my personal list of TODO-Notes on this project. Maybe there is something for you to do as well :)

## Hardware

- Add a reverse polarity protection to the board
- Add holes to the board to attach a plexiglass cover

## Important

- Fix Problems with programmers that are not recognised propperly

## Documentation

- How to use quartus?
- How to use template project?
- How to create own project from scratch?

## Getting started
- create some example projects and a "getting started" guide
    - blinking LED
    - Frequency Divider
    - Counter (7-Seg. Display) + Debouncer for Buttons
    - 7-Segment Display: Bin2Hex
    - Dice with PRNG

## Enthusiast features
- write own GUI application to draw circuits and call Quartus in the background for synthesis and upload (alternatively finalise the overlay). This UI needs to be better than the Quartus Software.
- Finally make the "Overlay" work!
