MAX ii Workbench for Education and Learning - MAXwel

**This project is currently under heavy development.**

MAXwel is a cheap and simple FPGA development board made for educational purposes. It is based in a low-cost Altera MAX ii Chip (EPM240), containing 240 logic elements, 8Kbits of RAM and 32Kbits of flash memory. The board is equipped with 8 switches, 4 push-buttons, 16 LEDs (8 Red and 8 green) and 4 7-segment displays. It also contains a 50MHz oscillator and a 14,7456 MHz oscillator as a clock source. The board is programmed through a USB Blaster JTAG interface with the pin-header located on the board.

Documentation is going to be available in the near future. (currently on the TODO list). The first version of the board was ordered a few days ago and is expected to arrive in the next few weeks (as of 2021-09-10) for testing and validation.
