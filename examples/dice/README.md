# BIN2HEX

This example uses the 50 MHz onboard oscillator and divides the frequency down to 1 Hz. The reduces frequency drives a Linear feedback shift register (LFSR) to generate pseudo random number. When a button is pressed, a new random number from 1 to 6 is shown the 7-Segment display. Open the `.qpf` file with Quartus to view the source, compile the project and upload it to the device.
