# Lab Course

The MAXwel Circuit board is used for a [Physics Lab Course at KIT](https://gitlab.kit.edu/kit/etp-lehre/p1-praktikum/students/-/tree/main/Schaltlogik?ref_type=heads). Within this Lab course students explore the basics of digital electronics and learn how to design and implement digital circuits. To design the circuits the schematics editor within the Quartus Software is used.

This directory offers a predefined template for the students as well as reference designs for the exercises. It also ships european style logic symbols for the template.
